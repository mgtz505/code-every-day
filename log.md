# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 6th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Let's go! Set up my TWTR account to document my progress and set up my repo. As part of Hackweek, I'm going to attempt to learn the following technologies:

- React Native
- socket.io
- Figma (Some exposure, but looking to learn more)
- Surveymonkey (Organizing meetings for student orgs doesn't count!)


**Thoughts:** My sister is a middle school teacher in Boston. She's told me numerous times over the past month that many of her students, having lost immediate and/or extended family members to COVID, are pretty anxious about re-entering the classroom environment. I'm proposing the development of a mobile application that allows teachers and students to message each other regarding their feelings / concerns about COVID-compliance in the classroom. 


I've built out my proposal in the Google Doc linked below.

This evening I took some time to learn how to create a real-time chat application using Socket.io! I found a nifty intro tutorial in the Socket documentation and coded along. This will likely be the cornerstone for my Hack Week project.

### Day 2: April 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Learning some React Native to being implementing my project for HackWeek. I'm coding along w/ a Udemy tutorial and tonight, made a very simple to-do list application. Honestly, 70% of the struggle was simply getting RN set-up and connected to my iPhone. 


**Thoughts:** React Native seems  (and I hope I don't jynx myself here) pretty manageable. The styling protocol is different (No CSS!?!) and it's pretty wild to think that you can build a mobile application with so few components.

### Day 3: April 8th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Making this commmit a day late, but I was up late working!. I'm still making great headway with my RN skills and am excited to report that I've broken ground on my HackWeek project. There's a good amount I still need to tackle, but the new syntax, components and lack of CSS is somewhat more manageable. I additionally worked with Native-base, a framework that's analgous to Bootstrap. I've had great luck thus-far with using it!


**Thoughts:** Nothing too inceremental, but I will say, it's pretty remarkable to see how much more readily you can pick up a new framework / language once you already have on under your belt. Between RN, Python and Django, it's beena. busy week!

### Day 4,5,6: April 8th-04/11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Well, I dropped the ball! I coded on all three days (and have the commits to prove it ;) , but I didn't keep my log current or send out my accountability tweet. On a more positive note, I've completed my React Native project! I wrote about it extensively in my ReadMe within that repo. If you, valued reader, are more interested in a quick take on my experience, check out my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mgtz505/trying-to-keep-comfy-a-react-native-5-day-trial-by-fire-2ooh) post about Comfy Classroom. 


**Thoughts:** It's pretty incredible how once you have a single language under your belt, other languages (as demonstrated w/ Python) and frameworks (React Native) can be tackled in a pretty expedient manner. Sure, I'm far from being an expert dev, but I do have comptenacy in RN and can now say that I've shipped a mobile application!

### Day 7, April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Phew! Wrapping up that project was a relief. I'm glad to have some RN in my back pocket. Excited for Project Four on the horizon, but need to recharge my batteries first. For today, I tackled a Codewars 7 kata. Perhaps not the most skilled kata (not even close actually haha) but it got the job done for today. 

**Thoughts:** 
On a side note, I'm very excited for [GA's upcoming product week](https://generalassemb.ly/hit-play-tech-conference-2021/product-week?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=2021-q2-global-marketing-campaign-hit-play-conference)! I've registered for five lectures and am stoked to learn more about PM responsabilities and best-practices for the recruiting gauntlet.

### Day 8, April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Making good headway w/ Django and RESTful APIs in class. Pretty tired from that spring for cozy classroom, so nothing too ambitious for today. Chose to work on webscraping in python. Trying to scrape an analyst note, which may not be the easisest, but would certainly be pretty cool to actually accomplish.

**Thoughts:** 
I miss javascript! Nah, python isn't too bad and I can certainly see the appeal.

### Day 9, April 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Been working on getting ramped up for our capstone project! Today I did some review python code exercises to hopefully iron-down this language's fundamentals. 

**Thoughts:** 
I came across this [list](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/21-python-mini-projects-with-codes-c4126e4131e4) and might try some of these as little side projects. We shall see!

### Day 10, April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Whew! Been making a TON of progress on my proposal for our capstone project. I spent a ton of time working though some wireframing in Figma using some pre-fab templates, creating a component hierarchy diagram as well as a User Flow chart for my proposed app's functionality. This was a beast of an undertaking for a single night, but I think it came out really well. Setting up the Jira and Agile workflow was pretty fun!

**Thoughts:** 
I really enjoy the project planning process. Seeing all of these ideas ceoma live on the paper (while knowing that they're fragile and will almost certainly change) is pretty exciting.

### Day 11, April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got the greenlight to proceed with our project! This afternoon, after watching some mock technical interviews, Guillermo and I went about setting up our GitHub repos for this project and discussing how we wanted to proceed getting up-and-running. 
**Thoughts:** 
Very excited to begin! If this React-pdf node package is easy to work with, we could land up making a pretty impressive application.

### Day 12, April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Ah React Router, my old friend. Spent this evening getting our front-end environment ready for action (i.e. getting Bootstrap and all our other dependencies installed). Not installing or working with React-pdf yet, but began reading through the documentation. Looks like a pretty slick node package. I'm excited to see if we can make some nice resumes.

**Thoughts:** 
Pretty straight forward day. Used good ol' grid to get my layouts nice and organized.

### Day 14, April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made some incredible progress today. We're getting to hit MVP much sooner than anticipated. Needless to say, at this juncture, feeling pretty stoked about how well this project is progressing. React-pdf is great (so far, knock on wood) to work with and our rendered template look great. There's a lot of gront work with setting up some of these form fields, but c'est la vie.

**Thoughts:** 
We're gonna make a great final product!

### Day 15, April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Our resume and cover letter now render perfectly! I need to work on making my React code DRYer... but we're super super close to hitting MVP. Feels pretty great.

**Thoughts:** 

Lot of redundancies I need to address.

### Day 16, April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: We hit MVP, but got bogged down working through some rebases. Hopefully tomorrow we can work toward integration of the indeed and/or LinkedIn APIs.

**Thoughts:** 
Finish line is in sight!

### Day 17, April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: MAde great headway on cleaning up the application. Tomorrow I'm going to need to spend some time working on making the styling dynamic. Cahnged my page width and was horrified how the site looked. Need to stop using pixels when playing w/ CSS! Also happy to say that I worked through more of my Google Coursera PM coursework. Today we covered (at a very high level) waterfall vs agile vs lean six sigma.
**Thoughts:** 
Finish strong!

### Day 18, April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got a ton today with our app's CSS as well as implmentation of some dynamic charts from Levels.fyi

Pretty stoked to see this all come together.
**Thoughts:** 

We should be ready to deploy tomorrow afternoon!

### Day 19, April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Well, we ran into a git issue. Seems as though GH is not recognizing that our rebases are complete, and moreover, oddly enough, our main branch is behind the Dev branch despite all of our merges haveing been successfully completed. Odd to say the least.
**Thoughts:**

### Day 20, April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Some simple updates to the Homepage.js as well as fixing some CSS grid issues in Accounts.js as well as the integreated Levels.fyi components, but otherwise nothing too dramatic to report.

### Day 21, April 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Boom! We're deployed. Squared away some last-minute CSS formatting, did a bug test and ensured all templates render correctly. Good to go!

### Day 22, April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Put the finishing touches on Resu.me! Excited to see this go live and hopefully get some traction! Graduation day as well! Feels bittersweet but can't wait to see what the future brings.

### Day 23, April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Grinded out 123 exp on Edabit (gotta love that similarity to good ol' adjusted EBITDA) in both Python and JS. Didn't realize that I was on a free trial! I enjoyed the platform more than codewars, but don't know if I want to shell out the $ when Codewars is a free platform, especially given that I probably need to purchase a DS / Algo course.
