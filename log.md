# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 6th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Let's go! Set up my TWTR account to document my progress and set up my repo. As part of Hackweek, I'm going to attempt to learn the following technologies:

- React Native
- socket.io
- Figma (Some exposure, but looking to learn more)
- Surveymonkey (Organizing meetings for student orgs doesn't count!)


**Thoughts:** My sister is a middle school teacher in Boston. She's told me numerous times over the past month that many of her students, having lost immediate and/or extended family members to COVID, are pretty anxious about re-entering the classroom environment. I'm proposing the development of a mobile application that allows teachers and students to message each other regarding their feelings / concerns about COVID-compliance in the classroom. 


I've built out my proposal in the Google Doc linked below.

This evening I took some time to learn how to create a real-time chat application using Socket.io! I found a nifty intro tutorial in the Socket documentation and coded along. This will likely be the cornerstone for my Hack Week project.

### Day 2: April 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Learning some React Native to being implementing my project for HackWeek. I'm coding along w/ a Udemy tutorial and tonight, made a very simple to-do list application. Honestly, 70% of the struggle was simply getting RN set-up and connected to my iPhone. 


**Thoughts:** React Native seems  (and I hope I don't jynx myself here) pretty manageable. The styling protocol is different (No CSS!?!) and it's pretty wild to think that you can build a mobile application with so few components.
