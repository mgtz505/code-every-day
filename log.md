# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Whoa, where's the content?

I had intitially started the 100 Days of Code challenge shortly before my intensive concluded in late April. I diligently abided by my daily commits to this repo, but after I began interview prep, my consistency worsened, and soon enough my commits were occuring every-other-day. Working exclusively in Code Signal and LeetCode's IDE was certainly somewhat responsible, but simply put, I just didn't stick with consistent commits despite (still) dilligently coding.

I'm restarting the 100 Days of Code Challenge, if not on Twitter, then at the least, back here in this repo. I've copied and pasted my old entries below as a time capsule of sorts, a window into the early days fo my development as a software engineer. That said, let's get down to business and see what the next 100 days throws my way!

### A Fresh Start - Day 1: July 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**
In preperation for some upcoming front end engineering interviews, I've been brushing up on my React. It's been a couple weeks since I last took React for a spin, having focused almost exclusively on practing DS&A in Python (namely Leetcode and CodeSignal, though [Project Euler](https://github.com/mgtz505/project_euler) also got some love. I've also been teaching myself Go through a combination of a Udemy Course as well as various online resources. It's been a joy thus-far and I can see why it gets so much love from the developer community.

**Thoughts**
Excited for a fresh start and for my upcoming interviews. Will need to be juggling DS&A prep with front end as well as keeping up my mometum with Go, but happy to embrace the challenge.

Nothing for Today, but for the sake of establishing consistency, here's a link to the repo containing my Golang excerises: [Learning Go!](https://github.com/mgtz505/Go-Exercises)

### Day 2: July 23rd, 2021
**Today's Progress**
I spent most of today applying for various roles, but did do some practice with Redux. Additionally completed several more Golang practice exercises.

### Days 3, 4, 5: July 26th, 2021
**Today's Progress**
It's been a whirlwind couple of days. I didn't make my commits, but got a ton done and am pretty proud of what I accomplished, including some React and GraphQL practice as well as making continued progress with Go. I need to loop some DS&A practice back into my routine soon... been a while since I took python for a spin.

### Day 6, July 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress**
Today was spent familiarizing myself with Docker! I followed along with various egghead.io tutorials as well as various Youtube tutorials as a supplement. I think that it'd be great practice to attempt to containerize some of my older projects. I additionally explored Recoil. As I understand it, Recoil is still not industry standard relative to Redux or MobX, but Recoil feels immensively more intuitive to use. 

On a side note, I also broke 400 commits for my personal GH account today! Inclusive of those from my SEI GH Enterprise account, that puts me at North of 500 YTD commits :)

## Time Capsule (April 6th - May 12th):

### Day 1: April 6th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Let's go! Set up my TWTR account to document my progress and set up my repo. As part of Hackweek, I'm going to attempt to learn the following technologies:

- React Native
- socket.io
- Figma (Some exposure, but looking to learn more)
- Surveymonkey (Organizing meetings for student orgs doesn't count!)


**Thoughts:** My sister is a middle school teacher in Boston. She's told me numerous times over the past month that many of her students, having lost immediate and/or extended family members to COVID, are pretty anxious about re-entering the classroom environment. I'm proposing the development of a mobile application that allows teachers and students to message each other regarding their feelings / concerns about COVID-compliance in the classroom. 


I've built out my proposal in the Google Doc linked below.

This evening I took some time to learn how to create a real-time chat application using Socket.io! I found a nifty intro tutorial in the Socket documentation and coded along. This will likely be the cornerstone for my Hack Week project.

### Day 2: April 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Learning some React Native to being implementing my project for HackWeek. I'm coding along w/ a Udemy tutorial and tonight, made a very simple to-do list application. Honestly, 70% of the struggle was simply getting RN set-up and connected to my iPhone. 


**Thoughts:** React Native seems  (and I hope I don't jynx myself here) pretty manageable. The styling protocol is different (No CSS!?!) and it's pretty wild to think that you can build a mobile application with so few components. 

**Links to today's work:** 
- [My Repo for Intro to React Native](https://github.com/mgtz505/intro-to-rn)

### Day 3: April 8th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Making this commmit a day late, but I was up late working!. I'm still making great headway with my RN skills and am excited to report that I've broken ground on my HackWeek project. There's a good amount I still need to tackle, but the new syntax, components and lack of CSS is somewhat more manageable. I additionally worked with Native-base, a framework that's analgous to Bootstrap. I've had great luck thus-far with using it!


**Thoughts:** Nothing too inceremental, but I will say, it's pretty remarkable to see how much more readily you can pick up a new framework / language once you already have on under your belt. Between RN, Python and Django, it's beena. busy week!

### Day 4,5,6: April 8th-04/11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Well, I dropped the ball! I coded on all three days (and have the commits to prove it ;) , but I didn't keep my log current or send out my accountability tweet. On a more positive note, I've completed my React Native project! I wrote about it extensively in my ReadMe within that repo. If you, valued reader, are more interested in a quick take on my experience, check out my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mgtz505/trying-to-keep-comfy-a-react-native-5-day-trial-by-fire-2ooh) post about Comfy Classroom. 


**Thoughts:** It's pretty incredible how once you have a single language under your belt, other languages (as demonstrated w/ Python) and frameworks (React Native) can be tackled in a pretty expedient manner. Sure, I'm far from being an expert dev, but I do have comptenacy in RN and can now say that I've shipped a mobile application!

### Day 7, April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Phew! Wrapping up that project was a relief. I'm glad to have some RN in my back pocket. Excited for Project Four on the horizon, but need to recharge my batteries first. For today, I tackled a Codewars 7 kata. Perhaps not the most skilled kata (not even close actually haha) but it got the job done for today. 

**Thoughts:** 
On a side note, I'm very excited for [GA's upcoming product week](https://generalassemb.ly/hit-play-tech-conference-2021/product-week?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=2021-q2-global-marketing-campaign-hit-play-conference)! I've registered for five lectures and am stoked to learn more about PM responsabilities and best-practices for the recruiting gauntlet.

### Day 8, April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Making good headway w/ Django and RESTful APIs in class. Pretty tired from that spring for cozy classroom, so nothing too ambitious for today. Chose to work on webscraping in python. Trying to scrape an analyst note, which may not be the easisest, but would certainly be pretty cool to actually accomplish.

**Thoughts:** 
I miss javascript! Nah, python isn't too bad and I can certainly see the appeal.

### Day 9, April 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Been working on getting ramped up for our capstone project! Today I did some review python code exercises to hopefully iron-down this language's fundamentals. 

**Thoughts:** 
I came across this [list](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/21-python-mini-projects-with-codes-c4126e4131e4) and might try some of these as little side projects. We shall see!

### Day 10, April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Whew! Been making a TON of progress on my proposal for our capstone project. I spent a ton of time working though some wireframing in Figma using some pre-fab templates, creating a component hierarchy diagram as well as a User Flow chart for my proposed app's functionality. This was a beast of an undertaking for a single night, but I think it came out really well. Setting up the Jira and Agile workflow was pretty fun!

**Thoughts:** 
I really enjoy the project planning process. Seeing all of these ideas ceoma live on the paper (while knowing that they're fragile and will almost certainly change) is pretty exciting.

### Day 11, April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got the greenlight to proceed with our project! This afternoon, after watching some mock technical interviews, Guillermo and I went about setting up our GitHub repos for this project and discussing how we wanted to proceed getting up-and-running. 
**Thoughts:** 
Very excited to begin! If this React-pdf node package is easy to work with, we could land up making a pretty impressive application.

### Day 12, April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Ah React Router, my old friend. Spent this evening getting our front-end environment ready for action (i.e. getting Bootstrap and all our other dependencies installed). Not installing or working with React-pdf yet, but began reading through the documentation. Looks like a pretty slick node package. I'm excited to see if we can make some nice resumes.

**Thoughts:** 
Pretty straight forward day. Used good ol' grid to get my layouts nice and organized.

### Day 14, April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made some incredible progress today. We're getting to hit MVP much sooner than anticipated. Needless to say, at this juncture, feeling pretty stoked about how well this project is progressing. React-pdf is great (so far, knock on wood) to work with and our rendered template look great. There's a lot of gront work with setting up some of these form fields, but c'est la vie.

**Thoughts:** 
We're gonna make a great final product!

### Day 15, April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Our resume and cover letter now render perfectly! I need to work on making my React code DRYer... but we're super super close to hitting MVP. Feels pretty great.

**Thoughts:** 

Lot of redundancies I need to address.

### Day 16, April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: We hit MVP, but got bogged down working through some rebases. Hopefully tomorrow we can work toward integration of the indeed and/or LinkedIn APIs.

**Thoughts:** 
Finish line is in sight!

### Day 17, April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: MAde great headway on cleaning up the application. Tomorrow I'm going to need to spend some time working on making the styling dynamic. Cahnged my page width and was horrified how the site looked. Need to stop using pixels when playing w/ CSS! Also happy to say that I worked through more of my Google Coursera PM coursework. Today we covered (at a very high level) waterfall vs agile vs lean six sigma.
**Thoughts:** 
Finish strong!

### Day 18, April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got a ton today with our app's CSS as well as implmentation of some dynamic charts from Levels.fyi

Pretty stoked to see this all come together.
**Thoughts:** 

We should be ready to deploy tomorrow afternoon!

### Day 19, April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Well, we ran into a git issue. Seems as though GH is not recognizing that our rebases are complete, and moreover, oddly enough, our main branch is behind the Dev branch despite all of our merges haveing been successfully completed. Odd to say the least.
**Thoughts:**

### Day 20, April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Some simple updates to the Homepage.js as well as fixing some CSS grid issues in Accounts.js as well as the integreated Levels.fyi components, but otherwise nothing too dramatic to report.

### Day 21, April 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Boom! We're deployed. Squared away some last-minute CSS formatting, did a bug test and ensured all templates render correctly. Good to go!

### Day 22, April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Put the finishing touches on Resu.me! Excited to see this go live and hopefully get some traction! Graduation day as well! Feels bittersweet but can't wait to see what the future brings. 

**Links to today's work:** 
- [Deployed Application](https://resume-render21.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 23, April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Grinded out 123 exp on Edabit (gotta love that similarity to good ol' adjusted EBITDA) in both Python and JS. Didn't realize that I was on a free trial! I enjoyed the platform more than codewars, but don't know if I want to shell out the $ when Codewars is a free platform, especially given that I probably need to purchase a DS / Algo course. 

**Links to today's work:** 
- [Edabit Problems](https://edabit.com/user/8cJcmDhFqGcM6LFQc)

### I fell off the bandwagon here with the daily updates! I got a ton done during this chunk of time, and have a ton of exciting opportunities in the works. I'm trying to piece-back togther what I worked on (namely a ton of practice coding questions in python via edabit and leetcode, a Udemy course on Data Structures and Algorithms in python, and supplementary questions from Cracking the Coding Interview).

### Day 24, April 28th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Got my 2nd shot of the Pfizer Covid vaccine and boy is it a doozy. Going to be on the sidelines.

### Day 25, April 29th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Making excellent progress with my Google Coursera curriculum in project management. I'm keeping my coding skills sharp with some practive in Edabit and am practicing python to supplement my JS skills. 

### Day 26, April 30th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continuing my Coursera work and additionally supplementing with Edabit practice quesions!

### Day 27, May 1st, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continuing my Coursera work and additionally supplementing with Edabit practice quesions!

### Day 28, May 2nd, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continuing my Coursera work and additionally supplementing with Edabit practice quesions!

### Day 29, May 3rd, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continuing my Coursera work and additionally supplementing with Edabit practice quesions!

### Day 30, May 4th, 2021
**Today's Progress**:  Purchased a Udemy course for [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/algorithms-and-data-structures-in-python/) after some exciting news about a potential referral for an awesome role. Gotta get some practice in!

### Day 31, May 5th, 2021 
**Today's Progress**: Covered a review of Big O, arrays / lists and intro to linked list. Supplemented with some Edabit python practice.

### Day 32, May 6th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Covered a review of Linked-Lists, Stacks and Queues. All the while I've been pounding those applications! 

### Day 33, May 7th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Covered a review of Trees! Binary search trees are pretty darn nifty. The implementation takes a while, but hopefully I can improve with practice. Need to continue practicing! I also helped Guillermo out by conducted a mock technical interview for him. I had him share hsi screen while I gave him an Edabit JS practice question. Teamwork makes the dream work!

### Day 34, May 8th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Took the day to just do practice questions in Edabit becuase I felt that my coding chops were getting a little rusty. It's a balancing act with that Udemy course!

### Day 35, May 9th, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Covered a red/black and AVL trees. Seems a little too advanced for an entry-level / junior interview? At least that's how these youtube gurus make it seem. Regardless, can't hurt to have some exposure.

### Day 36, May 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Pretty exciting day as I got my portfolio off the ground using gatsby.js. I worked through a decent chunk of a youtube tutorial making a simple hello world-esque gatsby site, then went ahead and explored Gatsby's starter offerings. I came across a beautiful starter that was the perfect springboard for my portfolio. I don't want this to be my "forever" portfolio, but for now I think it's a great asset.

### Day 37, May 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Phew! The work jsut keeps coming. I'm seeing some traction with my applications and that's pretty exciting. I've been continuing to grind on my Udemy course, Edabit, and now worked in some LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview practice problems. I need to get more rote practice with DS implementation; lecture style learning just isn't resonating with me all that well.

### Day 38, May 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working through Cracking the coding interview algo questions and also making headway with some Interview Cake practice problems. Also getting some practice implementing some data structures from scratch. Have some interviews lined up so that's super exciting (and nerve-wracking in all honesty). I spent the afternoon working through some front-end practice questions covering rudimentary JS, CSS, HTML. I'm making a register of all those questions ina. GOOGL sheet, so it should be a pretty great resource. The practice has also been jogging my memory.



### If you made it this far, you're a hero. Thanks for reading this repo!
