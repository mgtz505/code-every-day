# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 6th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Let's go! Set up my TWTR account to document my progress and set up my repo. As part of Hackweek, I'm going to attempt to learn the following technologies:

- React Native
- socket.io
- Figma (Some exposure, but looking to learn more)
- Surveymonkey (Organizing meetings for student orgs doesn't count!)


**Thoughts:** My sister is a middle school teacher in Boston. She's told me numerous times over the past month that many of her students, having lost immediate and/or extended family members to COVID, are pretty anxious about re-entering the classroom environment. I'm proposing the development of a mobile application that allows teachers and students to message each other regarding their feelings / concerns about COVID-compliance in the classroom. 


I've built out my proposal in the Google Doc linked below.

This evening I took some time to learn how to create a real-time chat application using Socket.io! I found a nifty intro tutorial in the Socket documentation and coded along. This will likely be the cornerstone for my Hack Week project.

### Day 2: April 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Learning some React Native to being implementing my project for HackWeek. I'm coding along w/ a Udemy tutorial and tonight, made a very simple to-do list application. Honestly, 70% of the struggle was simply getting RN set-up and connected to my iPhone. 


**Thoughts:** React Native seems  (and I hope I don't jynx myself here) pretty manageable. The styling protocol is different (No CSS!?!) and it's pretty wild to think that you can build a mobile application with so few components.

### Day 3: April 8th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Making this commmit a day late, but I was up late working!. I'm still making great headway with my RN skills and am excited to report that I've broken ground on my HackWeek project. There's a good amount I still need to tackle, but the new syntax, components and lack of CSS is somewhat more manageable. I additionally worked with Native-base, a framework that's analgous to Bootstrap. I've had great luck thus-far with using it!


**Thoughts:** Nothing too inceremental, but I will say, it's pretty remarkable to see how much more readily you can pick up a new framework / language once you already have on under your belt. Between RN, Python and Django, it's beena. busy week!

### Day 4,5,6: April 8th-04/11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Well, I dropped the ball! I coded on all three days (and have the commits to prove it ;) , but I didn't keep my log current or send out my accountability tweet. On a more positive note, I've completed my React Native project! I wrote about it extensively in my ReadMe within that repo. If you, valued reader, are more interested in a quick take on my experience, check out my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mgtz505/trying-to-keep-comfy-a-react-native-5-day-trial-by-fire-2ooh) post about Comfy Classroom. 


**Thoughts:** It's pretty incredible how once you have a single language under your belt, other languages (as demonstrated w/ Python) and frameworks (React Native) can be tackled in a pretty expedient manner. Sure, I'm far from being an expert dev, but I do have comptenacy in RN and can now say that I've shipped a mobile application!

### Day 7, April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Phew! Wrapping up that project was a relief. I'm glad to have some RN in my back pocket. Excited for Project Four on the horizon, but need to recharge my batteries first. For today, I tackled a Codewars 7 kata. Perhaps not the most skilled kata (not even close actually haha) but it got the job done for today. 

**Thoughts:** 
On a side note, I'm very excited for [GA's upcoming product week](https://generalassemb.ly/hit-play-tech-conference-2021/product-week?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=2021-q2-global-marketing-campaign-hit-play-conference)! I've registered for five lectures and am stoked to learn more about PM responsabilities and best-practices for the recruiting gauntlet.

### Day 8, April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Making good headway w/ Django and RESTful APIs in class. Pretty tired from that spring for cozy classroom, so nothing too ambitious for today. Chose to work on webscraping in python. Trying to scrape an analyst note, which may not be the easisest, but would certainly be pretty cool to actually accomplish.

**Thoughts:** 
I miss javascript! Nah, python isn't too bad and I can certainly see the appeal.
